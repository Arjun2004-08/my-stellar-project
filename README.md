# 🏛️ Governance Token Platform

> A fully on-chain, decentralized governance system built on **Stellar** using **Soroban** smart contracts. Token holders vote on proposals, delegate their power, and drive protocol decisions — all enforced trustlessly by the contract.

## 📖 Project Description

The **Governance Token Platform** is a production-ready smart contract written in Rust for the [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) smart contract environment on Stellar. It combines an **ERC-20-style governance token** with a complete **on-chain proposal and voting system**, giving communities the tools to collectively manage protocols, treasuries, and parameter changes in a transparent, censorship-resistant way.

Every governance action — minting, burning, delegating, proposing, voting, and executing — is recorded on the Stellar ledger and emitted as a contract event, providing a full, auditable history of community decisions.

## ⚙️ What It Does

```
Token Holder
    │
    ├─► Transfer / Mint / Burn tokens
    │
    ├─► Delegate voting power to another address
    │
    └─► Governance Lifecycle
            │
            ├─[1]─► create_proposal()  ──► Proposal stored on-chain
            │
            ├─[2]─► vote()             ──► For / Against / Abstain
            │         (within voting window after delay)
            │
            ├─[3]─► finalize_proposal() ─► Passed / Rejected (quorum check)
            │
            └─[4]─► execute_proposal()  ─► Executed (admin marks done)
```

1. **Token management** — deploy with an initial supply; the admin can mint or burn tokens; anyone can transfer freely (locked tokens excluded).
2. **Delegation** — lock tokens and lend your voting weight to a trusted delegate without giving up token ownership.
3. **Proposal creation** — any token holder can author a text proposal (title + description). A configurable delay prevents flash-loan style attacks before voting begins.
4. **Voting** — every holder (or their delegate) casts a weighted vote during the open period. Votes are final once cast.
5. **Finalization** — anyone can trigger finalization after the period ends; the contract computes quorum and majority automatically.
6. **Execution** — admin marks passed proposals as executed, signalling off-chain systems to act (e.g., treasury release, parameter change).

## ✨ Features

### 🪙 Governance Token
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Transferable** | Standard peer-to-peer transfers with balance validation |
| **Mintable** | Admin-controlled minting for rewards, grants, or genesis distributions |
| **Burnable** | Token holders can burn their own tokens to reduce supply |
| **Supply tracking** | Accurate `total_supply` updated on every mint/burn |

### 🗳️ Voting & Delegation
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Weighted votes** | Voting power = own available balance + delegated power |
| **Delegation** | Delegate any amount to a third party; tokens are locked during delegation |
| **Undelegation** | Remove delegation at any time to reclaim voting power |
| **Double-vote guard** | On-chain mapping prevents the same address from voting twice on a proposal |
| **Vote transparency** | All vote choices queryable on-chain |

### 📜 Proposal System
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Rich proposals** | Each proposal stores title, description, proposer, and full vote tallies |
| **Configurable delay** | `vote_delay_ledgers` enforces a waiting period before voting starts |
| **Configurable period** | `vote_period_ledgers` sets how long voting stays open |
| **Quorum enforcement** | Configurable `quorum_percentage` (1–100) — rejects proposals with too low participation |
| **Multi-status lifecycle** | `Active → Passed/Rejected → Executed` or `Active → Cancelled` |
| **Cancellation** | Proposer or admin can cancel active proposals |

### 🔐 Access Control
| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Admin role** | Single privileged address for minting, executing, and parameter changes |
| **Admin transfer** | Ownership can be handed off to a multisig or DAO contract |
| **`require_auth()`** | All state-changing calls require the appropriate Soroban auth check |

### 🔧 Governance Parameters
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `quorum_percentage` | 10% | Minimum participation required for a vote to be valid |
| `vote_delay_ledgers` | 50 | Ledgers between proposal creation and voting start |
| `vote_period_ledgers` | 200 | Ledgers the voting window stays open |

## 📡 Events

All state changes emit Soroban events for off-chain indexers and frontends:

| Event Topic | Data | When |
|---|---|---|
| `(init, admin)` | `(Address, i128)` | Contract initialised |
| `(transfer,)` | `(from, to, amount)` | Tokens transferred |
| `(mint,)` | `(Address, i128)` | Tokens minted |
| `(burn,)` | `(Address, i128)` | Tokens burned |
| `(delegate,)` | `(delegator, delegatee, amount)` | Delegation created |
| `(undelegat,)` | `(delegator, delegatee)` | Delegation removed |
| `(proposal,)` | `(proposer, id, start, end)` | Proposal created |
| `(vote,)` | `(voter, proposal_id, power)` | Vote cast |
| `(finalize,)` | `(id, total_votes, status)` | Proposal finalized |
| `(execute,)` | `proposal_id` | Proposal executed |
| `(cancel,)` | `proposal_id` | Proposal cancelled |
| `(newadmin,)` | `Address` | Admin transferred |

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **All mutating functions** call `require_auth()` on the relevant signer — Soroban enforces this at the VM level.
- **Locked tokens** during delegation cannot be transferred or burned, preventing double-spend voting exploits.
- **Vote-delay period** gives token holders time to acquire or delegate before voting begins, mitigating flash-loan governance attacks.
- **Quorum requirement** prevents a small, coordinated minority from passing proposals during low participation.
- **Double-vote guard** is stored in persistent storage, surviving across ledger boundaries.
- **No cross-contract calls** in this version — eliminates re-entrancy vectors.

> ⚠️ This contract has **not yet been audited**. Use on mainnet only after a professional security review.
